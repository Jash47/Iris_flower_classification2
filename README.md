# Iris Flower Classification ML Project : 

This repository contains the code and resources for the Iris Flower Classification ML Project. The project aims to classify different types of Iris flowers based on their petal and sepal characteristics using various Machine Learning algorithms. 

## Dataset
The project utilizes the renowned Iris dataset, which consists of measurements of petal and sepal lengths and widths for three different species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset is widely used in the field of Machine Learning for classification tasks and serves as an excellent starting point for beginners.

The dataset is included in the repository under the data directory. It is stored in a CSV format, with each row representing an individual sample and columns containing the feature values and corresponding target labels.

## Requirements: 
To run the project code, you will need the following dependencies:

1) Python 3.x
2) NumPy
3) Pandas
4) Scikit-learn

## Project Structure: 
The repository is organized as follows:

- data/: Contains the Iris dataset file (iris.csv).
- notebooks/: Includes Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- models/: Stores the trained machine learning models.
- scripts/: Contains utility scripts for data preprocessing and evaluation.
- README.md: Provides information about the project and how to use it.
